# Rats-in-the-Restaurants

## Week 1: Presentation

Health inspections occur for the safety of the public to keep restaurants up to date with health codes.  Health violations such as rats found in restaurants is one type of violation code that would lower the grade of the restaurant.  This analysis will help determine which restaurants are prone to more health violations, based on location in Los Angeles County.

## Features and Target

## Contribution
My contribution was to create a presentation (Google Slides) that represents and deliver our project.  Also, while merging the dataframes, there were nulls that could not be merged due to diffeerent location names.  To resolve this issue, I clustered the cities with the closest city and similar background i.e. wealth, style, demographic.
