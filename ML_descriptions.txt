# Description of preliminary data preprocessing 
We took several data transformation and preprocessing steps upon continuous data exploration and analysis. They were broken down
into the following parts.

    Part one of the data preprocessing included:
        * abstracting only restaurants, coordinates, and seats numbers
        * dropping unwanted columns, renaming kept columns
        * changing data types
        * replacing null values with appropiate values
    Part two of the data preprocessing included:
        * replacing missed null values
        * dropping unwated columns
    Part three of the data preprocessing included:
        * modifying "Activity Date" to include "MONTH-YEAR" and "MONTH" columns
        * creating a new column from 'SEATS' into 'new_seats' that represents "seat bins"
        * dropping unwated columns
    Part four of the data preprocessing included:
        * setting facility city = "Los Angeles, City of"
        * dropping columns consisting of categorical data

# Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including their decision-making process
We conducted linear regression analysis to assess a restaurant's "score" versus each potential feature selection (n=43). The analysis
included determining p-values and r-values to better understand significance and correlations among our data. This process helped
inform our feature selection. 

# Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
We attempted to use an linear SVC model where we selected our y-values to be "SCORE" and x-values to be the remaining numerical 
features (n=43). We separated our data into training and testing set that included the parameters:
    * random state = 42  
    * stratisfy = "Y"

# Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
The linear SVC model presented several limitations. Running our model took a couple of hours to complete, and it resulted in a very 
low accuracy score (about 6%). Upon discussing and re-evaluting our model, we decided on reducing our feature selections to about handful
based on the highest r-values from our linear regression analysis and limiting restaurants to Los Angeles city only. We tested this approach
on a random forest model, which still procuded a low accuracy score. We reverted back to keeping all our feature selections and keeping all
cities in Los Angeles County. Our random forest model then produced an accuracy score of about 70%.
