DATA TRANSFORMATIONS//CHECKLIST:

**inspections_df** clean up in python
- [DONE] filter by restaurants only
- [DONE] get 'no. of seats', 'risk', and 'type' from 'pe_description' columns
- [DONE] get 'lat' & 'lng' from 'location' column

- OUTPUT #1: clean_inspections.csv

**violations_df** clean up in python
- no cleaning needed
- no dropping columns needed

**inspections_violations_df** clean up in python
- [DONE] merge 'inspections_df' and 'violations_df' on 'serial_number'
- OUTPUT #2: clean_inspections_violations.csv

NEXT STEPS:

PYTHON
* Data cleaning in Python:
    - [DONE] 'inspections'
    - [DONE] 'violations'
    - [DONE] 'community health' 
    - [DONE] ensure no nulls and correct data types across the 3 datasets
    - Final datasets:
            -- clean_inspections.csv
            -- clean_violations.csv
            -- clean_community_health.csv

SQL
* Data cleaning in SQL:
    - review 'Facility City' from 'clean_inspections.csv' so that it can match with'GEONAME' from 'clean_communityhealth.csv'
* Use the 3 clean datasets to create 3 tables:
    - clean_inspections.csv
    - clean_violations.csv
    - clean_community_health.csv
* Merging/joining of datasets to take place in SQL
    - Any additional merging/joining?
    - Final SQL dataset: 
        -- inspections_violations_communityhealth.csv for Machine Learning

NOTE: In SQL, keep clean_inspections as the master file (keep untouch), update community_health instead?

API/JSON
