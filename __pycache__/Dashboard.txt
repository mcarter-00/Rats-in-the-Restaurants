The dashboard tool that is utilized for this project is Tableau.
Tableau is a powerful and user friendly data visualization tool helps in simplifying raw data into a easy, visual and  understandable format.

The merged and cleaned dataset is uploaded into Tableau in CSV format
The raw data is transformed into easy to digest dashboards with insight information
Dashboards are published in Tableau service available to the public

The dashboards will follow the below storyline:
1) High level overview of the full dataset, bringing insights about number of facilities per cities, number of inspections per facility, heat map of zip codes per scores, type of violations, etc
2) Dashboards will deepdive into 6 violations that would mostly impact people's decisions on choosing a restaurant. This dashboard will map where restaurants with this type of violations are located, their grade, their size, etc. This dashboard will be interactive, and it will be possible to filter by grade and type of violation
3) The last part of the story is to see if Los Angeles demographic dataset could bring any additional information about the zipcodes with worst scores presenting the one of the 6 violations.
